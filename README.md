ATM Withdrawal System Features

1. Create User:
    * Allows new users to create an account by providing an account number, PIN, and initial balance. The system checks for duplicate account numbers to ensure uniqueness.
2. Login:
    * Users can log into their accounts by entering their account number and PIN. The system verifies these credentials and grants access if they are valid.
3. Logout:
    * Ends the current session, clearing user data and resetting any failed attempts. This ensures that the account is secure after the user has finished their transactions.
4. Authenticate User:
    * The system checks the entered account number and PIN against stored values. If the credentials are incorrect after three attempts, the account is locked for security.
5. Check Balance:
    * Once authenticated, users can view their current account balance. This feature helps users stay informed about their funds before making transactions.
6. Deposit Money:
    * Users can add funds to their account by specifying an amount to deposit. The system updates the balance accordingly, allowing for easy management of funds.
7. Withdraw Money:
    * Users can request to withdraw a specific amount. The system checks if sufficient funds are available and if the daily withdrawal limit has not been exceeded before processing the transaction.
8. Print Receipt:
    * After a successful withdrawal, the system generates a receipt detailing the withdrawn amount and the remaining balance. This provides a record of the transaction for the userâ€™s reference.
